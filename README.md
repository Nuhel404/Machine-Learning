Breast Cancer Prediction
Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not.

We used a dataset that contains various features such as the patient's age, tumor size, and tumor grade, along with the diagnosis (i.e., malignant or benign) to train and test our model. We explored different machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to build the best possible model that accurately predicts breast cancer.

Dependencies
Python 3.7
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
Installation
Clone the repository.

Dataset
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We performed data preprocessing and cleaning techniques to prepare the data for model training.

Training
We trained several models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and Random Forest, on the training dataset using scikit-learn. We used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of the models using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also generated a confusion matrix to visualize the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

Results
Our best-performing model was the Random Forest, which achieved an accuracy of 95%. The precision, recall, and F1 score were also high, indicating that the model was able to accurately predict breast cancer. The confusion matrix showed that the model had a high true positive rate and a low false negative rate, which is desirable for a breast cancer prediction model.

Future Work
In the future, we plan to explore other machine learning techniques and algorithms to improve the model's performance. We also hope to incorporate additional features, such as genetic data, to make the model more accurate.
